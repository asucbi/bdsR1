The data you find on Kaggle includes all accidents across the United States for six years (almost 3 million cases!). You will also find the complete set of variables described on Kaggle. If you haven't set up an account, you really should give it a go.
```

In this assignment we'll look at traffic accidents in Phoenix.
The data are made available on Kaggle [online](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents?resource=download) by a scientist at Lyft named Sobhan Moosavi. We will see more on Kaggle throughout the course as it's a great way to find public datasets. 

The data covers all recorded car accidents in Phoenix from January 2016 to January 2022. Note that some of the variables were modified for the purpose of this assignment.

# Getting started

First, open the R Markdown document `mod-03-hw.Rmd` and knit it. Make sure it compiles without errors.

## Warm up

Before we introduce the data, let's warm up with a simple exercise.

-   Update the YAML, changing the author name to your name, and **knit** the document.

## Packages

We'll use the **tidyverse** package for much of the data wrangling and visualization. This package is already installed for you. You can load it by running the following in your Console:

```{r load-packages, message = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Data

The data is in two files and both are hanging out in an online repository. The first file is called `phoenix_accidents_1.csv` and the second file is called `phoenix_accidents_2.csv`. 

```{marginfigure}
Notice that the `read_csv` function is able to retrieve these files just as long as you give it the correct URL to the repository. 
```

We need to load in the data before we can do anything with it. We use the function `read_csv()` to do so. 

```{r load-data, message = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
phx_accidents_1 <- 
  read_csv("https://asucbi.github.io/data/phoenix_accidents_1.csv") 

phx_accidents_2 <- 
  read_csv("https://asucbi.github.io/data/phoenix_accidents_2.csv") 
```

```{r echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
phx_accidents = left_join(phx_accidents_1, phx_accidents_2, by="id")
```

# Exercises

1.  Create a code chunk (give it a sensible name) and join `phx_accidents_1` and `phx_accidents_2` datasets into a single dataset and call it `phx_accidents`. Be sure to join `by=` the common variable between the two datasets. 

1. What does each row in the joined dataset represent?

The variable (column) descriptions for the joined dataset are as follows. Read through them, try to get a sense of what you have available:

| Variable Name                                      | Description                                                                                                                                                |
|----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `id` | Accident ID |
| `latitude` | Latitude of accident location |                                                                                             
| `longitude` | Longitude of accident location |
| `severity` | Shows the severity of the accident in terms of traffic delay: Minor/Slight, Moderate, Severe |
| `road_length` | The length of the road extent affected by the accident (in miles) |
| `dateof` | Date of the accident |
| `day_of_week` | Day of the week of the accident |
| `month_of_year` | Month of the year of the accident |
| `week_of_year` | Week of the year of the accident |
| `time` | Time of the accident on the 24h clock |
| `zipcode` | Phoenix area zipcode |
| `highway` | Whether the accident occurred on a city street or on a highway |
| `street` | Shows more detailed information on street/highway location in address field |
| `side` | Shows the relative side of the street (Right/Left) in address field. |
| `special_cond` | Special condition that was recorded for the location of the accident: Traffic light/stop sign, Pedestrian crossing, Road/highway junction, Other, Unknown |
| `light` | Light condition at the time of accident: Daylight, Darkness (artificial lights lit), Darkness (artificial lights unlit), Other |
| `weather` | Weather condition at the time of accident: Fine, Raining, Snowing, Fog or smoke or dust, Other, Unknown |
| `wind` | High winds (greater than 26 mph): Windy or Other |
| `wind_speed` | Shows wind speed (in miles per hour). |
| `precipitation` | Shows precipitation amount in inches, if there is any. |
| `visibility` | Shows visibility (in miles). |

1.  Create a new variable within the dataset called `day_of_week_type` that indicates whether the accident occurred on a Saturday or Sunday (if so, call it "Weekend"), and if not, call it "Weekday." You're going to need it for Exercise 4. 

```{r eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
phx_accidents <- phx_accidents %>% mutate(day_of_week_type = if_else(day_of_week %in% c("Sat", "Sun"), "Weekend", "Weekday"))
```

1.  Recreate the following plot, and describe in context of the data. In your answer, don't forget to label your R chunk as well (where it says `label-me-1`). Your label should be short, informative, shouldn't include spaces, and shouldn't shouldn't repeat a previous label.

```{r eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, fig.fullwidth = TRUE}
phx_accidents %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = time, fill = severity)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.50) +
  facet_wrap(~day_of_week_type, ncol = 1) +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_viridis_d() +
  labs(
    title = "Number of accidents throughout the day",
    subtitle = "By day of week and severity",
    x = "Time of day",
    y = "Density",
    fill = "Severity"
  ) 
```

- __HINT__ Somewhere in your code you want to add "theme_minimal()" to accurately recreate.

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
phx_accidents %>%
  ggplot(___) +
  ___() +
  ___() +
  theme_minimal()
```

1.  Create another data visualization based on these data and provide a written interpretation. You can choose any variables and any type of visualization you like^[however,  no animated plots please], but it must have at least three variables, e.g. a scatterplot of x vs. y isn't enough, but if points are colored by z, that's fine. In your answer, don't forget to label your R chunk as well (where it says `label-me-2`).

# Submitting your work

Once you are happy with the final state of your work, change the YAML `output` from `html_output` to `pdf_output.` Now knit the document to produce a final PDF file. Upload the PDF as a Canvas assignment.
