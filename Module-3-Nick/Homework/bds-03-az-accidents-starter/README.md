This README is meant to go in a Github repository. But if we are not going to use Github, a better strategy might be to ask students to knit as a html while working on things.
When they are done, they will then change output to "pdf_document" and this is what they will submit. We will need to give explicit instructions for how to do this.

If things are being done through RStudio Cloud, when they knit the final PDF, is it easy enough to extract and submit through Canvas for grading? Submit in some other way?
