## Data science

.pull-left-wide[
- Data science is an exciting discipline that allows you to turn raw data into understanding, insight, and knowledge. 

- We're going to learn to do this in a `tidy` way -- more on that later!

- This is a course on introduction to data science, with an emphasis on critical thinking.

## Course FAQ

.pull-left-wide[
**Q - What data science background does this course assume?**  
A - None.

**Q - Is this an intro stat course?**  
A - While statistics $\ne$ data science, they are very closely related and have tremendous of overlap. Hence, this course is a great way to get started with statistics. However this course is *not* your typical high school statistics course.

**Q - Will we be doing computing?**   
A - Yes.

## Course FAQ

.pull-left-wide[
**Q - Is this an intro CS course?**  
A - No, but many themes are shared.

**Q - What computing language will we learn?**  
A - R.

**Q: Why not language X?**  
A: We can discuss that over `r emo::ji("coffee")`.

# Let's dive in and do a bit of live-coding

---

# To Do

- Let's go over syllabus and schedule

- Let's go over Canvas setup

- Let's go over setup for Week 1 HW and Lab (go to next slide)

---

## Getting Started I

- Follow instructions on the "Info on Posit Cloud (for HWs, Labs, and All Analyses)" page on Canvas for getting an account

- Lets upload the HW starter file for Canvas. Download the `.RMD` file from the instructions page on Canvas to your computer. In RStudio, go to the `Files` tab in the bottom-right console and then click `Upload` document to upload the `.RMD` file.  

- Click the `.RMD` file to see it Viewer. You may be automatically asked to install a package called `tidyverse`. If so, accept the install. Otherwise I will show you how to install manually using something called `install.packages()`

- In the Console window, type `install.packages("devtools")` then type `devtools::install_github("asucbi/bdsdata")`

- Knit the starter file and see what happens

---

## Getting Started II

- Now that we have a PDF file, go ahead and export it to your harddrive to upload to Canvas (hit the checkmark next to the file and go to the `More` dropdown menu and click `Export`)

- Lets do a little setup to change the feel of things (change the look, view in panel)
