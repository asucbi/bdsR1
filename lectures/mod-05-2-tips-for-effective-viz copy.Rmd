# Designing effective visualizations

## Keep it simple

.pull-left-narrow[
```{r pie-3d, echo = FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/pie-3d.jpg")
```
]
.pull-right-wide[
```{r pie-to-bar, echo = FALSE, out.width="100%"}
d <- tribble(
  ~category, ~value,
  "Cutting tools", 0.03,
  "Buildings and administration", 0.22,
  "Labor", 0.31,
  "Machinery", 0.27,
  "Workplace materials", 0.17
)
ggplot(d, aes(x = fct_reorder(category, value), y = value)) +
  geom_col() +
  theme_minimal() +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(x = "", y = "")
```
]



---

## Use	color	to	draw	attention

.pull-left[
```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="100%"}
d %>%
  mutate(category = str_replace(category, " ", "\n")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = category, y = value, fill = category)) +
  geom_col() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "", y = "") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="100%"}
ggplot(d, aes(x = fct_reorder(category, value), y = value, fill = category)) +
  geom_col() +
  theme_minimal() +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(x = "", y = "") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("red", rep("gray", 4))) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```
]

## Tell a story

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/time-series-story.png")
```

# Principles	for	effective	visualizations

## Principles	for	effective	visualizations

- Order matters
- Put long categories on the y-axis
- Keep	scales consistent
- Select meaningful colors
- Use meaningful and nonredundant labels

## Data

In January 2023, YouGovAmerica survey asked 915 US adults the following question:

> Which ONE, if any, of the following statements do you MOST agree with?
>
>- Most robots have already developed higher levels of intelligence than humans
>- Robots will be able to develop higher levels of intelligence than humans in the future
>- Robots will never be able to develop higher levels of intelligence than humans

--

> Which ONE, if any, of the following statements do you MOST agree with?
>
>- Already surpassed
>- Surpass in future
>- Never surpass
