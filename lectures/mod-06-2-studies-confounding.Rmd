## Scientific studies

.pull-left[
**Observational**  
- Collect data in a way that does not interfere with how the data arise ("observe")
- Establish associations
]
.pull-right[
**Experimental**  
- Randomly assign subjects to treatments
- Establish causal connections
]

---

.question[
What type of study is the following, observational or experiment? What does that mean in terms of causal conclusions?

*Researchers studying the relationship between exercising and energy levels asked participants in their study how many times a week they exercise and whether they have high or low energy when they wake up in the morning.*

*Based on responses to the exercise question the researchers grouped people into three categories (no exercise, exercise 1-3 times a week, and exercise more than 3 times a week).* 

*The researchers then compared the proportions of people who said they have high energy in the mornings across the three exercise categories.*

.question[
What type of study is the following, observational or experiment? What does that mean in terms of causal conclusions?

*Researchers studying the relationship between exercising and energy levels randomly assigned participants in their study into three groups: no exercise, exercise 1-3 times a week, and exercise more than 3 times a week.* 

*After one week, participants were asked whether they have high or low energy when they wake up in the morning.*

*The researchers then compared the proportions of people who said they have high energy in the mornings across the three exercise categories.*

# Case study: Breakfast cereal keeps girls slim

.midi[
> *Girls who ate breakfast of any type had a lower average body mass index (BMI), a common obesity gauge, than those who said they didn't. The index was even lower for girls who said they ate cereal for breakfast, according to findings of the study conducted by the Maryland Medical Research Institute with funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and cereal-maker General Mills.* [...]
>
> *The results were gleaned from a larger NIH survey of 2,379 girls in California, Ohio, and Maryland who were tracked between the ages of 9 and 19.* [...]
>
>*As part of the survey, the girls were asked once a year what they had eaten during the previous three days.* [...]

## Explanatory and response variables

- Explanatory variable: Whether the participant ate breakfast or not

- Reponse variable: BMI of the participant


---

## Three possible explanations

--

1. Eating breakfast causes girls to be slimmer 


--
2. Being slim causes girls to eat breakfast


--
3. A third variable is responsible for both -- a **confounding** variable: an extraneous variable that affects both the explanatory and the response variable, and that makes it seem like there is a relationship between them

# Case study: Lead exposure and personality

---

## Does lead exposure *cause* people to be less agreeable?

In our dataset of country-level averages, we saw there was an _association_ between lead exposure and agreeableness. 

.hand[But is this relationship a causal one?]

---

## Potential confound 1: Cultural differences

In our earlier lab, we speculated there might be some cultural differences that might explain the differences, and made some maps to explore these.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(patchwork)
## noticing some xaringan theme problems
survey <- read_csv("../data/eu-pers-survey.csv")
eudata <- read_csv("../data/eu-country-data.csv")

eudata <- eudata %>% 
  mutate(
    Country = case_when(
     Country=="Bosnia and Herzegovina" ~  "Bosnia & Herzegovina",
     Country== "Czech Republic" ~ "Czechia",
     TRUE ~ Country
  )
  )

combined <- left_join(eudata, survey, by = "Country")

d <- map_data("world") %>% 
  right_join(combined, by = c("region"="Country"))

# insert the maps here

# 
# d %>% 
#   pivot_longer(
#     c(mean_a, mean_leadexposure),
#     names_to = "Var",
#     values_to = "Value"
#   ) %>% 
ggplot(d, aes(x=long, y = lat, group=group, fill = mean_leadexposure)) + 
  geom_polygon() + 
  scale_fill_viridis_c() +
  coord_fixed()  +
  labs(fill="Lead Exposure") 
  # theme(legend.position="bottom") +

# ggplot(d, aes(x=long, y = lat, group=group, fill = mean_a)) + 
#   geom_polygon() + 
#   scale_fill_viridis_c() +
#   coord_fixed() +
#   labs(fill="Agreeableness") +
#   theme(legend.position="bottom")
```

---

## Potential confound 2: Economic prosperity

Could it be true that:

- More prosperous countries are better able to reduce environmental lead exposure?
- Prosperity makes people more agreeable?


```{r, echo=F, warning=F, fig.showtext=TRUE}
library(dagitty)
library(xaringanthemer)
library(ggdag)

dag_confound <- dagitty('dag {
    Lead [pos="0,-1"]
    GDP [pos=".5,0"]
    Agree [pos="1,-1"]
    
    GDP -> Lead
    GDP -> Agree
}')

ggdag::tidy_dagitty(dag_confound, layout="auto") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=x,y=y,xend=xend,yend=yend)) +
  geom_dag_text(size=10) +
  geom_dag_edges_link(edge_color="white") +
  theme_xaringan(use_showtext=F) + 
  theme(
    panel.grid=element_blank(), 
    axis.title=element_blank(),
    axis.text = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks = element_blank(),
    )

```

## Visualizing associations between all variables

.question[
Are lead exposure, agreableness, and GDP per capita dependent or independent?
]

```{r, echo=F, warning=F}
library(patchwork)
# 3 scatterplots here

ggplot(combined, aes(x=mean_leadexposure, y=mean_a)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method="lm") +
  theme_bw() +
  
ggplot(combined, aes(x=log(`GDP/capita/10000`), y=mean_leadexposure)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method="lm") +
  theme_bw() +  
  
ggplot(combined, aes(x=log(`GDP/capita/10000`), y=mean_a)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method="lm") +
  theme_bw() * theme(aspect.ratio=1)
```

--
.small[
These variables are all correlated---so economic prosperity (measured by GDP per capita) is a **potential confound**.
