## Statistical Infernence

> some quote from Jaynes

---

## Generalization

As (data) scientists, we want to draw inferences about the world from the limited set of observations (data) that we have

- Want to __generalize__ from a __sample__ to a __population__

( some kind of diagram for this)
---

## Uncertainty

- The inferences we make about the unobserved population are __uncertain__
- Statistics is all about describing and quantifying this uncertainty
- We measure uncertainty with __probabilities__

---

class: middle

# Intervals

## Estimation and intervals

So far we have done lots of estimation (mean, median, slope, etc.), i.e.
- used data from samples to calculate sample statistics
- which can then be used as estimates for population parameters

.question[
If you want to estimate a population parameter, do you prefer to report a range of values the parameter might be in, or a single value?
]

<br>

--

- If we report a point estimate, we probably wonâ€™t hit the exact population parameter
- If we report a range of plausible values we have a good shot at capturing the parameter

---

## The idea

- Statistics like means and regression coefficients are __point-values__: single values representing the best estimate.
- Can capture our degree of certainty or uncertainty in those estimates using an interval or range rather than a single value
- We'd like to say things like, our best estimate is X, and we're 95% sure the true value is between Y and Z.
- If the interval is small, then we've got a lot of certainty, if it's big, acknowledging more uncertainty

---

## Types of interval

.pull-left[
Frequentist __Confidence Intervals__

- XX% of the time we calculate such an interval, it will contain the population parameter 
]

.pull-right[
Bayesian __Credible Intervals__

- The range of plausible values in which we believe the population parameter falls based on our model and observations, with XX% probability.
- "We estimate the mean is 4.3 with a 95% Credible Interval of 3.9 to 4.5" = we are 95% sure the mean is between 3.9 and 4.5
]

Intuitively, the Bayesian Credible interval is what we want, but the Frequentist interval is easier to calculate.

---

## Being loosely Bayesian

Sometimes, Frequentist confidence intervals and Bayesian credible intervals will be essentially identical
- In these cases, you can safely interpret confidence intervals like Bayesian credible intervals

--
.hand[When is this ok?]

- When you have a simple model (e.g. linear regression)
- And a good amount of data

## Calculating a confidence interval

$$CI_{95} = \text{Estimate} + - 1.96(\text{Std. Err.}) $$

.tip[
The formula for a confidence interval comes from the __Central Limit Theorem__
]

## Plotting confidence intervals

- `geom_pointrange()` plots a statistic and an error bar that can be used to represent an interval 
- This can be useful for plotting the confidence intervals around the means of different groups

```{r}
# some _data %>% 
# group_by() %>% 
# summarize(
# M = mean(),
# SE = sd()/sqrt(n()),
# ul = M + 1.96*SE,
# ll = M + 1.96*SE
# ) 
```


---

## CI for regression coefficients

```{r}
howell <- read_csv("../data/howell1.csv") %>% 
  filter(age >= 18)
```

```{r}
fit <- lm(weight ~ height, data = howell)
summary(fit)
```

---

## Computing confidence intervals for regression coefficients

Extract model coefficients with `broom::tidy()` and calculate manually:

```{r}
broom::tidy(fit) %>% 
  mutate(
    ll = estimate - 1.96 * std.error,
    ul = estimate + 1.96 * std.error
    )
```

Or for a single coefficient, use `confint()`:

```{r}
confint(fit, "height", .95)
```

---

## Plotting prediction intervals

- The `modelr` package can be useful for creating predictions from models.
- `data_grid()` and `seq_range()` functions can help create sequences of values for plotting across the range of a given dataset

```{r}
library(modelr)

pred_df <- data_grid(howell, height = seq_range(height, 100))

preds <- predict(fit, pred_df, se.fit=T)

pred_df <- pred_df %>% 
  mutate(
    predicted = preds$fit,
    ul = predicted + 1.96*preds$se.fit,
    ll = predicted - 1.96*preds$se.fit
  )

pred_df

```

## Plotting prediction intervals (2)


```{r}

ggplot() + 
  geom_point(data = howell, aes(x=height, y=weight)) +
  geom_line(data = pred_df, aes(x=height, y = predicted), color = "blue") +
  geom_ribbon(data = pred_df, aes(x=height, ymin = ll, ymax=ul), fill="blue", alpha=.25)
```
