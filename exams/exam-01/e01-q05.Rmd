flights <- flights %>% 
  slice_sample(prop=.35)
```


Sometimes when a flight leaves late you can "make it up in the air"---you can arrive on-time despite your late departure. Which of the following would add a variable representing this made-up time to the flights dataset?

A) `flights <- flights %>% mutate(make_up = dep_delay - arr_delay)`
B) `flights <- flights %>% summarize(make_up = dep_delay - arr_delay)` 
C) `flights <- flights %>% mutate(make_up == dep_delay / arr_delay)` 
D) `flights <- flights %>% summarize(make_up == dep_delay / arr_delay)`
