> The last few questions have involved selecting a subset of the 19 variables from the `flights` data frame. To answer this question, it is highly advisable that you first review the names of all the variables. You can find them in the instructions (above) from the `?flights` documentation.

(NOTE: THERE ARE MULTIPLE CORRECT RESPONSES)

A) `select(flights, ends_with("arr_time"), ends_with("dep_time"))`

B) `select(flights, contains("_time"), contains("arr_"))`

C) `select(flights, "dep_time", "dep_delay", "arr_time", "arr_delay")`

D) `select(flights, starts_with("dep_"), starts_with("arr_"))`
