set.seed(42)

flights <- flights %>% 
  slice_sample(prop=.35)
```


Say we just wanted to focus on all the flights leaving from or arriving to JFK. How could we begin a pipeline that would analyze only these flights?

A) `flights %>% filter(origin == "JFK", dest == "JFK")`
B) `flights %>% select(origin == "JFK", dest == "JFK")`
C) `flights %>% filter(origin == "JFK" | dest == "JFK")`
D) `flights %>% select(origin == "JFK" | dest == "JFK")`
