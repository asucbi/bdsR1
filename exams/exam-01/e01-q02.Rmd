```{r, include=F, dependson="setup.R"}
## Exam 1 specific

library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)

set.seed(42)

flights <- flights %>% 
  slice_sample(prop=.35)
```


What code could have produced the output below showing the raw number and proportion of flights originating at each NY-area airport: 

```{r, echo=F}
flights %>% 
  count(origin) %>% 
  mutate(
  prop = n/sum(n)
)
```


A)
```
flights %>% 
  count(origin) %>% 
  mutate(
  prop = n/sum(n)
)
```
B)
```
flights %>% 
  count(origin, n, prop)
```
C) 
```
flights %>% 
  distinct(origin, n, prop)
```
D)
```
flights %>% 
  group_by(origin) %>% 
  summarize(
  n = n(),
  prop = n/total
)
```
