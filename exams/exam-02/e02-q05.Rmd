> Consider the relationships between three variables, $X$, $Y$, and $Z$. $Y$ is being considered an outcome (perhaps it occurs temporally after $X$ and $Z$). Below are the coefficients from three regression analyses, each predicting $Y$. Based on these, which interpretation seems most likely to be true?

```{r}
fit1
fit2
fit3
```


A) $X$ is a common cause of $Y$ and $Z$
B) $X$ causes $Z$, which causes $Y$
C) $X$ and $Z$ are both independent causes of $Y$
D) Neither $X$ nor $Z$ are related to $Y$
