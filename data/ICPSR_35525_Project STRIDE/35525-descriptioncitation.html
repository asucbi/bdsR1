		        		<h2>Project Description:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Summary:</strong> <p>Project STRIDE is a three-year research project that examines the effect of stress and minority identity related to sexual orientation, race/ethnicity and gender on mental health. The research describes social stressors that affect minority populations, explores the coping and social support resources that they utilize as they confront these social stressors, and assesses the associations of stress and coping with mental health outcomes including mental disorders and wellbeing. The study also explores the impact of various identity characteristics, such as whether an identity is viewed positively or negatively, or whether it is prominent or not to the relationship of stress and mental health outcomes.</p>
<p>The study, using extensive quantitative and some qualitative measures, is a longitudinal survey of 525 men and women between the ages 18 and 59 who are residents of New York City. Socio-demographic information collected about respondents included age, education, race and Hispanic ethnicity, adopting the measures developed and used by the United States Census Bureau in the United States population survey of 2000. In addition to these items, racial/ethnic identity was also assessed with the question "What is the country of origin related to your or your family's ethnic or national background, if any?" Respondents were allowed to select up to two nations from a comprehensive listing. For the purposes of the study, the instrument also assessed whether or not participants were natives of New York City or migrated as adults. Additional demographic variables include employment status, religion, relationship status, and sexual orientation.</p></span></p>

		        		<h2>Methodology:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Study Purpose:</strong> The primary aims of the project were: (a) to describe identity structures and social stressors related to prejudice among minority group members, (b) to explore coping and social support resources that minority group members use to confront social stressors, and (c) to assess the associations among stress, identity, and mental health problems.</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Study Design:</strong> The study used a longitudinal design with measures at baseline and after a one-year follow-up.
More information is available in the document "Project Stride Methodology and Technical Notes".</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Sample:</strong> Respondents were selected from among eligible screened individuals using a representative case quota sampling method (Shontz, 1965) to fill 16 cells of a table corresponding to variation in gender (male and female), sexual orientation (LGB and straight), race/ethnicity (White, Black, and Latino), and age group (18-30 and 31-59). Individuals were eligible to participate in the study if they (a) self-identified as male or female and were assigned that sex at birth; (b) self-identified as lesbian, gay, bisexual (LGB), straight, or used other terms conveying such identification (e.g., queer, heterosexual); (c) self-identified as White, Black, or Latino or used other terms conveying such identifications (e.g., Hispanic, African American); (d) were between 18 and 59 years of age; (e) resided in New York City for two years or more; and (f) were able to speak English well enough to engage in casual conversation. Individuals were not eligible to participate in the study if a close family member or live-in partner already participated in the study.</span></p>
