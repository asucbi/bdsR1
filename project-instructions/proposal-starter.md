## Section 1. Introduction (Data and Research Questions)

The introduction should introduce your data and general research
questions.

Tell us where your data comes from, how it was collected, what each row
represents, and what are the key variables you are interested in.

Prepare several research questions that you might answer with this data.
Remember, your research questions should have something to do with a
meaningful human behavior or psychological process.

Be sure to include: Put your data in the /data folder, make sure the
notebook includes the output of glimpse() or skim() of your data frame
that shows the dimensions of the dataset and the variables you are
interested in.

## Section 2. Analysis plan

For each of your research questions, include:

- Which variables you will use to help answer your questions.

- Describe the visualizations you will make along with some explanation
  on how they help you learn more about your data. Feel free to add
  images (screenshots) to your document to help with the explanation.

- What results from these visualizations would help to support different
  hypotheses?

The entire proposal should be AT LEAST 2 pages and no more than 5 pages
(including code blocks, code output, images, and text). You can check a
print preview to confirm length.
