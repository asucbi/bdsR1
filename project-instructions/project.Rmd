# TL;DR

Pick a dataset, any dataset...

...and do something with it.
That is your final project in a nutshell.
More details below.

# May be too long, but please do read

The final project for this class will consist of analysis on a dataset of your own choosing.
The dataset should be publicly available and should not be a dataset that you have already collected or worked with in your own independent research (for MS and PhD students).

The goal of this project is for you to demonstrate proficiency in the techniques we have covered in this class (and beyond, if you like) and apply them to a novel dataset in a meaningful way.

You should:

- Identify a dataset you are interested in
- Identify a specific research question (or questions) that this data can help answer
- Create a visualization or vizualizations that help answer your question(s)
- (optionally) Create a model or calculate a statistic that helps answer your question(s)


The goal is not to do an exhaustive data analysis i.e., do not calculate every statistic and procedure you have learned for every variable, but rather show that you are proficient at asking meaningful questions and answering them with results of data analysis, that you are proficient in using R, and that you are proficient at interpreting and presenting the results.
Focus on methods that help you begin to answer your research questions.
Also, critique your own methods and provide suggestions for improving your analysis.
Issues pertaining to the reliability and validity of your data, and appropriateness of the statistical analysis should be discussed here.

<!-- The project is very open ended. -->
<!-- You should create some kind of compelling visualization(s) of this data in R. -->
<!-- There is no limit on what tools or packages you may use, but sticking to packages we learned in class (`tidyverse`) is required. -->
<!-- You do not need to visualize all of the data at once. -->
<!-- A single high quality visualization will receive a much higher grade than a large number of poor quality visualizations. -->
<!-- Also pay attention to your presentation. -->
<!-- Neatness, coherency, and clarity will count. -->
<!-- All analyses must be done in RStudio, using R. -->

## Data

In order for you to have the greatest chance of success with this project it is important that you choose a manageable dataset.
This means that the data should be readily accessible and large enough that multiple relationships can be explored.
As such, your dataset must have at least 50 observations and between 10 to 20 variables (exceptions can be made but you must get approval first).

Ideally, the dataset's variables should include both categorical variables and numerical variables.

If you are using a dataset that comes in a format that we haven't encountered in class, make sure that you are able to load it into R as this can be tricky depending on the source. If you are having trouble ask for help before it is too late.

**Note on reusing datasets from class:** Do not reuse datasets used in examples, homework assignments, or labs in the class.

## Team **deliverables**

1.  Dataset and research question approval - due [ENTER DUE DATE]
1.  Proposal - due [ENTER DUE DATE]
2.  Analysis notebook - due [ENTER DUE DATE]
3.  Presentation - due [ENTER DUE DATE -- same as analysis notebook due]

### Dataset and research question approval

Each team must meet briefly with one of the instructors to explain (verbally) their dataset selection and proposed research question(s). This is ungraded, but it is an important chance to get feedback and make sure your team is on the right track before the proposal.

- Your dataset should have the features described above and must include variables relating to human behaviors or psychological processes, broadly construed.
- Your research question should have something to do with a meaningful human behavior or psychological process.

### Proposal

This is a draft of the introduction section of your project as well as a data analysis plan and your dataset.

-   **Section 1 - Introduction:** The introduction should introduce your general research question and your data. Be sure to include, where the data came from, how it was collected, what each row represents, and what are the key variables you are interested in.

-   **Section 2 - Data:** Place your data in the \`/data\` folder, make sure the notebok includes the output of `glimpse()` or `skim()` of your data frame that shows the dimensions of the dataset and the variables you are interested in.

-   **Section 3 - Research question:** What is the research question that you will use this data to help answer? Remember, your research question should have something to do with a meaningful human behavior or psychological process. If your ideas have changed since we last discussed them, you are advised to reach out with questions as you write this.

-   **Section 4 - Analysis plan:** For each of your research questions, include:

    -   The outcome (response, Y) and predictor (explanatory, X) variables you will use to answer your question.

    -   The comparison groups you will use, if applicable.

    -   Very preliminary exploratory data analysis, including some summary statistics and visualizations, along with some explanation on how they help you learn more about your data.
        (You can add to these later as you work on your project.)

    -   The method(s) that you believe will be useful in answering your question(s).
        (You can update these later as you work on your project.)

    -   What results from these specific statistical methods are needed to support your hypothesized answer?

Each section should be no more than 1 page (excluding figures).
You can check a print preview to confirm length.

Your projects will be **peer reviewed** by 3-4 of your peers and each of you will be responsible for peer reviewing one other team's proposal. Each team will then rate how helpful each peer review was. 

< need a grading scheme -- Nick I've never done peer reviewed projects before so this is probably your purview >

<!-- The grading scheme for the project proposal is as follows. -->
<!-- Note that after you receive feedback for your proposal you can improve it based on the feedback and re-submit it. -->
<!-- If you re-submit, your final score for the proposal will be the average of two scores you receive (first and second submission). -->

<!-- +-----------------------------------------------------------+----------+ -->
<!-- | Total                                                     | 10 pts   | -->
<!-- +===========================================================+==========+ -->

<!-- +-----------------------------------------------------------+----------+ -->
<!-- | Proposal                                                  | 5 pts    | -->

<!-- +-----------------------------------------------------------+----------+ -->

### Presentation

**10 minutes maximum, and each team member should say something substantial.** Presentations will take place during the last X weeks of classes. Timeslots will be assigned to teams randomly.

<!-- You can either present live during your workshop or pre-record and submit your video to be played during the workshop. -->


**Your presentation should:**

- Introduce the dataset
- Introduce and explain your research question(s) 
   - Explain how you arrived at your research qeustion (was it based on theory? explain the theory. Based on earlier EDA? show this (at least partially))
   - Explain/motivate why your question(s) is meaningful or interesting
- Present and explain the visualization(s) you used to address your research question(s)
- (optionally) Present and explain any models you fit to address your research question(s)


**Details:**
- Prepare an RMarkdown document that you can use to support your presentation using the provided template. You should organize descriptions as bullet points (like you would for a powerpoint) and include outputs and figures within the notebook. Instead of advancing slides, you will just scroll through the notebook.

- There is no limit to the length of the notebook, just a time limit for the presentation (10 min)

<!-- This template uses a package called `xaringan`, and allows you to make presentation slides using R Markdown syntax. -->
<!-- There isn't a limit to how many slides you can use, just a time limit (5 minutes total). -->
- Each team member should get a chance to speak during the presentation.

Before you finalize your presentation, make sure your chunks are turned off with `echo = FALSE`.

<!-- Presentations will take place during the last workshop of the semester. -->
<!-- You can choose to do your presentation live or pre-record it. -->
<!-- During your workshop you will watch presentations from other teams in your workshop and provide feedback in the form of peer evaluations. -->
<!-- The presentation line-up will be generated randomly. -->

The grading scheme for the presentation is as follows:

+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------+
| Total                                                                                                                                                                                                          | 60 pts |
+================================================================================================================================================================================================================+========+
| Time management: Did the team divide the time well amongst themselves or got cut off going over time?                                                                                                          | 4 pts  |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------+

+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------+
| Professionalism: How well did the team present? Does the presentation appear to be well practiced? Did everyone get a chance to say something meaningful about the project?                                    | 5 pts  |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------+
| Teamwork: Did the team present a unified story, or did it seem like independent pieces of work patched together?                                                                                               | 6 pts  |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------+

+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------+
| Notebook: Was the notebook well organized, readable, not full of text, featuring figures with legible labels, legends, etc.?                                                                                   | 10 pts |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------+

### Notebook

Teams will also turn in the final Rmarkdown notebook they created for the presentation so that it can be graded as part of the presentation grade. This is just so that we can have enough time to look it over carefully. The notebook will be graded out of 10 points as explained in the above grading scheme.

Teams will turn in two files, turning in the notebook both as an `.Rmd` and as a `.Pdf` file

<!-- Along with your presentation slides, we want you to provide a brief summary of your project in the README of your repository. -->

<!-- This executive summary should provide information on the dataset you're using, your research question(s), your methodology, and your findings. -->

<!-- The executive summary is worth 15 points and will be evaluated based on whether it follows guidance and whether it's concise but detailed enough. -->

<!-- ### Repo organization -->

<!-- The following folders and files in your project repository: -->

<!-- -   `presentation.Rmd` + `presentation.html`: Your presentation slides -->
<!-- -   `README.Rmd` + `README.md`: Your write-up -->
<!-- -   `/data`: Your dataset in CSV or RDS format and your data dictionary -->
<!-- -   `/proposal`: Your project proposal -->

<!-- Style and format does count for this assignment, so please take the time to make sure everything looks good and your data and code are properly formatted. -->

<!-- ## Tips -->

<!-- -   You're working in the same repo as your teammates now, so merge conflicts will happen, issues will arise, and that's fine Commit and push often, and ask questions when stuck. -->

<!-- -   Review the marking guidelines below and ask questions if any of the expectations are unclear. -->

<!-- -   Make sure each team member is contributing, both in terms of quality and quantity of contribution (we will be reviewing commits from different team members). -->

<!-- -   Set aside time to work together and apart (physically). -->

<!-- -   When you're done, review the documents on GitHub to make sure you're happy with the final state of your work. -->
<!--     Then go get some rest! -->

<!-- -   Code: In your presentation your code should be hidden (`echo = FALSE`) so that your document is neat and easy to read. -->
<!--     However your document should include all your code such that if I re-knit your R Markdown file I should be able to obtain the results you presented. -->

<!--     -   Exception: If you want to highlight something specific about a piece of code, you're welcomed to show that portion. -->

<!-- -   Teamwork: You are to complete the assignment as a team. -->
<!--     All team members are expected to contribute equally to the completion of this assignment and team evaluations will be given at its completion - anyone judged to not have sufficient contributed to the final product will have their grade penalized. -->
<!--     While different teams members may have different backgrounds and abilities, it is the responsibility of every team member to understand how and why all code and approaches in the assignment works. -->

\* indicates individual score

### Criteria

Your project will be assessed on the following criteria:

-   Content - What is the quality of research and/or policy question and relevancy of data to those questions?
-   Correctness - Are statistical procedures carried out and explained correctly?
-   Writing and Presentation - What is the quality of the statistical presentation, writing, and explanations?
-   Creativity and Critical Thought - Is the project carefully thought out? Are the limitations carefully considered? Does it appear that time and effort went into the planning and implementation of the project?

A general breakdown of scoring is as follows:

-   90%-100% - Outstanding effort. Student understands how to apply all statistical concepts, can put the results into a cogent argument, can identify weaknesses in the argument, and can clearly communicate the results to others.
-   80%-89% - Good effort. Student understands most of the concepts, puts together an adequate argument, identifies some weaknesses of their argument, and communicates most results clearly to others.
-   70%-79% - Passing effort. Student has misunderstanding of concepts in several areas, has some trouble putting results together in a cogent argument, and communication of results is sometimes unclear.
-   60%-69% - Struggling effort. Student is making some effort, but has misunderstanding of many concepts and is unable to put together a cogent argument. Communication of results is unclear.
-   Below 60% - Student is not making a sufficient effort.

### Team peer evaluation

You will be asked to fill out a survey where you rate the contribution and teamwork of each team member out of 10 points.
You will additionally report a contribution percentage for each team member.
Filling out the survey is a prerequisite for getting credit on the team member evaluation. If you are suggesting that an individual did less than 20% of the work, please provide some explanation.
<!-- If any individual gets an average peer score indicating that they did less than 10% of the work, this person will receive half the grade of the rest of the group. -->

### Late work policy

-   There is no late submission / make up for the presentation. You must be in class on the day of the presentation to get credit for it *or* pre-record and submit your presentation by 9am in the morning of the presentations.
-   The late work policy for the write-up is 5% of the maximum obtainable mark per calendar day up to seven calendar days after the deadline. If you intend to submit work late for the project, you must notify the course organizer before the original deadline as well as as soon as the completed work is submitted on GitHub.
