## Hypothesis testing

- What we'd like to know: What is the probability that my hypothesis is right?
- This could come from Bayes' Rule

`$$P(h|d) = \frac{P(d|h)P(h)}{P(d)}$$`
--

- But we need to also calculate:
  - __prior__ (minor challenge)
  - __probability of the data__ (bigger challenge)

## Frequentist Null Hypothesis Testing

- What we'd like to know: What is the probability that my hypothesis is right?

--

- Instead, most hypothesis testing is conducted as __Null Hypothesis Testing__

.tip[
Calculate the probability that observations this extreme or more would have occurred by chance
]

---

## Logic of Null Hypothesis Testing

- Define a null hypothesis `\(H_0\)` and an "alternative" hypothesis `\(H_A\)`
  - `\(H_0\)` = "Nothing is going on"
  - `\(H_A\)` = "Something is going on
- Calculate a __p-value__: Probability of an observation as extreme or more under the null hypothesis
  - Asking: "Could these data plausibly have happened by chance if the null hypothesis were correct?"
  
__Logic of disjunction__
- If `\(p\)` is low, then either we've just witnessed a very low probability event, or the `\(H_0\)` is false. So we reject the null hypothesis

---

## NHST caveat: no p-values without models

.tip[
But, the idea that the "null hypothesis" says that "nothing is going on" is actually very misleading! The null hypothesis is actually a very specific "something"---a specific model that is used to calculate the probability of the observed result (or one more extreme).
]

.hand[p-value = probability of data as or more extreme __given__ the null model]

$$p = P(\text{obs as or more extreme as } d|H_0) $$
---

## NHST via simulation

- NHST relies on comparing our observed data to the observations we would expect to see if the null hypothesis were true
- One way to make this comparison is to __generate__ observations from the null hypothesis using __simulation__.

---

## Example: NYPD Stop-and-Frisk program
- Controversial (read: bad) NYPD practice of temporarily detaining, questioning, and at times searching civilians and suspects on the street for weapons and other contraband.

- Started under Mayor Rudy Giuliani, continued under Mayor Michael Bloomberg, and finally reformed by Mayor Bill De Blasio

- At its height in 2011, NYPD officers recorded conducting 685,724 stops with 88% (603,437) resulting in no conviction.
---

## Racial bias in NYPD's stop and frisk program

&gt; In total, Blacks and Hispanics represented 51% and 33% of the stops, despite being only 26% and 24%, of the city population based on the 1990 Census ... --- Gelman, Fagan, &amp; Kiss, 2007 (using data from 1998-1999)

- A judge ruled in 2013 that New York City’s stop-and-frisk program was carried out in a manner that violated the U.S. Constitution

- A number of studies have found no evidence that stop-and-frisk reduced crime

## Null Hypothesis

.tip[
`\(H_0\)`: Hispanic New Yorkers in Precinct 4 are stopped at a representative rate. 
]

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Plot]
&lt;img src="mod-09-3-NHST_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]
.panel[.panel-name[Code]


```r
total_stops &lt;- sum(precinct$stops)
hisp_prop &lt;- precinct %&gt;% filter(ethnicity=="hispanic") %&gt;% pull(prop_pop)
hisp_stops &lt;- precinct %&gt;% filter(ethnicity=="hispanic") %&gt;% pull(stops)

sim_data &lt;- tibble(
  stops = rbinom(10000, total_stops, hisp_prop)
)

ggplot(sim_data, aes(x=stops)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  geom_point(aes(y = 0, x = hisp_stops), color="red")
```
]
]

---

## Null hypothesis in numbers

.tip[
`\(H_0\)`: Hispanic New Yorkers in Precinct 4 are stopped at a representative rate. 
]


```r
sim_data %&gt;% 
  summarize(p = mean(stops &gt;= hisp_stops))
```

```
## # A tibble: 1 × 1
##        p
##    &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 0.0238
```


Only 2.49% of the simulated observations are as extreme or more than our observation for Precinct 4!

---

## Types of alternative hypotheses

- One sided (one tailed) alternatives: The parameter is hypothesized to be specifically less than or greater than the null value, `\(&gt;\)` or `\(&gt;\)`

--

- Two sided (two tailed) alternatives: The parameter is hypothesized to be not equal to the null value, `\(\ne\)`
    - Calculated as two times the tail area beyond the observed sample statistic
    - More generally applicable, and widely preferred

## Is yawning contagious?

.question[
Do you think yawning is contagious?
]


---

## Is yawning contagious?

An experiment conducted by the MythBusters tested if a person can be subconsciously influenced into yawning if another person near them yawns.

https://www.discovery.com/tv-shows/mythbusters/videos/is-yawning-contagious-2

---

## Study description

In this study 50 people were randomly assigned to two groups: 34 to a group where a person near them yawned (treatment) and 16 to a control group where they didn't see someone yawn (control).

The data are in the **openintro** package: `yawn`


```r
yawn %&gt;%
  count(group, result)
```

```
## # A tibble: 4 × 3
##   group result       n
##   &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt;    &lt;int&gt;
## 1 ctrl  not yawn    12
## 2 ctrl  yawn         4
## 3 trmt  not yawn    24
## 4 trmt  yawn        10
```

---

## Proportion of yawners

.small[

```r
yawn %&gt;%
  count(group, result) %&gt;%
  group_by(group) %&gt;%
  mutate(p_hat = n / sum(n))
```

```
## # A tibble: 4 × 4
## # Groups:   group [2]
##   group result       n p_hat
##   &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt;    &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 ctrl  not yawn    12 0.75 
## 2 ctrl  yawn         4 0.25 
## 3 trmt  not yawn    24 0.706
## 4 trmt  yawn        10 0.294
```
]

- Proportion of yawners in the treatment group: `\(\frac{10}{34} = 0.2941\)`
- Proportion of yawners in the control group: `\(\frac{4}{16} = 0.25\)`
- Difference: `\(0.2941 - 0.25 = 0.0441\)`
- Our results match the ones calculated on the MythBusters episode.

---

## Independence?

.question[
Based on the proportions we calculated, do you think yawning is really contagious, i.e. are seeing someone yawn and yawning dependent?
]


```
## # A tibble: 4 × 4
## # Groups:   group [2]
##   group result       n p_hat
##   &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt;    &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 ctrl  not yawn    12 0.75 
## 2 ctrl  yawn         4 0.25 
## 3 trmt  not yawn    24 0.706
## 4 trmt  yawn        10 0.294
```

---

## Dependence, or another possible explanation?

- The observed differences might suggest that yawning is contagious, i.e. seeing someone yawn and yawning are dependent.

- But the differences are small enough that we might wonder if they might simply be **due to chance**.

- Perhaps if we were to repeat the experiment, we would see slightly different results.

- So we will do just that - well, somewhat - and see what happens.

- Instead of actually conducting the experiment many times, we will **simulate** our results.

---

## Two competing claims

- "There is nothing going on." 
Yawning and seeing someone yawn are **independent**, yawning is not contagious, observed difference in proportions is simply due to chance. `\(\rightarrow\)` Null hypothesis

- "There is something going on."
Yawning and seeing someone yawn are **dependent**, yawning is contagious, observed difference in proportions is not due to chance. `\(\rightarrow\)` Alternative hypothesis

---

## Bootstrapped permutations test

`\(H_0\)`: There will be no difference in the rate of yawning between treatment and control groups, i.e. they are both drawn from the same population with respect to yawning.

__Bootstrapped Permutation Test__:

- Randomly draw observations from the entire sample (with replacement)
- Randomly assign those observations to "treatment" and "control" groups, ignoring their original labels
- Calculate the statistic of interest in both groups
- Repeat this process ~10,000 times
- Examine how many bootstrapped samples produced a difference in groups as large or larger as what was observed

.tip[
In __bootstrapping__, the observed data are __resampled with replacement__ to simulate repeated observations from the population. Bootstrapping can be used to compute confidence intervals and the probability of the observed data under the null hypothesis.

## Conducting a bootstrapped permutation test

.midil[
.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Plot]
&lt;img src="mod-09-3-NHST_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]
.panel[.panel-name[Plot Code]

```r
bootstrap_permutation &lt;- function(df){
  # shuffle the group labels
  group_labels &lt;- df %&gt;% sample_frac(1, replace=F) %&gt;% pull(group)
  
  x &lt;- df %&gt;% 
    mutate(group = group_labels)  %&gt;% # and assign new shuffled group labels
    group_by(group) %&gt;% 
    summarize(prop = mean(result=="yawn")) %&gt;% # calculate prop of yawners in each group
    pivot_wider(names_from = "group", values_from = "prop") %&gt;% 
    mutate(diff = trmt - ctrl) # compute difference btw groups
  
  return(x %&gt;% pull(diff)) # return the difference

}

null_dist &lt;- tibble(diff = replicate(1000, bootstrap_permutation(yawn)))

null_dist %&gt;% 
  ggplot(aes(x = diff)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  geom_point(aes(y = 0, x = 0.0441), color="red")
```
]

]
]
---

## Calculating p-value


```r
null_dist %&gt;% 
  filter(diff &gt;= 0.0441) %&gt;%
  summarise(p_value = n()/nrow(null_dist))
```

```
## # A tibble: 1 × 1
##   p_value
##     &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1     0.5
```

---

## Failing to reject the Null

.question[
So, are yawns contagious?
]

--

- In Frequentist statistics, we never __accept__ the null hypothesis
- We can only fail to reject it
