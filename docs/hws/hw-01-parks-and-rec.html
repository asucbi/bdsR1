<p>The goal of this assignment is to introduce you to R, RStudio, and
integration with Canvas, which you’ll be using throughout the course
both to learn the data science concepts discussed in the course and to
analyze real data and come to informed conclusions.</p>
<div id="getting-started" class="section level1">
<h1>Getting started</h1>
<div id="prerequisites" class="section level2"
data-link="Prerequisites">
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>This assignment assumes that you have completed all the steps in the
Canvas pages: “Posit Cloud: Setting up for Week 1” and on “Posit Cloud:
Editing and Preparing for Submission” to get yourself set up on Posit
Cloud. If you haven’t yet done so, please pause and complete it before
continuing.</p>
</div>
<div id="terminology" class="section level2">
<h2>Terminology</h2>
<p>We’ve already thrown around a few new terms, so let’s define them
before we proceed.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>R:</strong> Name of the programming language we will be
using throughout the course.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>RStudio:</strong> An integrated development environment
for R. In other words, a convenient interface for writing and running R
code.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Posit Cloud</strong> The online service for accessing
RStudio.</p>
<ul>
<li>In this course, assignment instructions you work on (HWs, Labs,
Project) will be available on Canvas. The “starter” documents needed to
complete each assignment will typically be available on Posit Cloud;
however, for Week 1, you need to download from the instruction page in
Canvas.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="starting-slow" class="section level2">
<h2>Starting slow</h2>
<p>As the course progresses, you are encouraged to explore beyond what
the assignments dictate; a willingness to experiment will make you a
much better programmer! Before we get to that stage, however, you need
to build some basic fluency in R. First, we will explore the fundamental
building blocks of R and RStudio.</p>
<p>Before you can get started with the analysis, you need to make sure
you:</p>
<ul>
<li>you are set up in the Posit Cloud space; if you are not, then you
did not complete the prerequisite for this assignment. Please go back to
<a href="#prerequisites">Prerequisites</a> and complete it.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="workflow" class="section level1">
<h1>Workflow</h1>
<p>For each assignment in this course you will go to a shared folder in
Posit Cloud that contains starter documents (except for Week 1 where you
will upload the document yourself). You will build upon this document
when working on your assignment. In Posit Cloud/RStudio you will edit
them, run them, view your results, and interpret them. In other words,
all data analysis will happen in Posit Cloud/RStudio.</p>
<p>Lets walk through some of the steps that will get you ready for
analysis.</p>
</div>
<div id="hello-rstudio" class="section level1">
<h1>Hello RStudio!</h1>
<p>For Week 1 only, you need to follow the instructions on the Canvas
page: “Posit Cloud: Setting up for Week 1” to get the homework .RMD file
loaded into your Posit Cloud/RStudio environment.</p>
<!-- Go to [rstudio.cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/ "RStudio Cloud") and then **navigate to the course workspace** via the left sidebar. It's very important that you do this for two reasons: -->
<!-- -   It's only when you're in the course workspace that you'll be able to benefit from R packages I've pre-installed for you so that your project can be configured correctly. -->
<!-- -   It's only when you're in the course workspace that your usage of RStudio Cloud won't count towards the free usage limits. -->
<p><img src="img/course-workspace.png" width="80%"  style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<!-- Before you proceed, confirm that you are in the course workspace by checking out what's on your top bar in RStudio Cloud. -->
<div id="rstudio-layout" class="section level2">
<h2>RStudio Layout</h2>
<p>RStudio is comprised of four panes.</p>
<div class="figure fullwidth">
<img src="img/rstudio-anatomy-new.png" alt=" " width="80%"  />
<p class="caption marginnote shownote">
</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>On the bottom left is the Console, this is where you can write code
that will be evaluated. Try typing <code>2 + 2</code> here and hit
enter, what do you get?</li>
<li>On the bottom right is the Files pane, as well as other panes that
will come handy as we start our analysis.</li>
<li>If you click on a file, it will open in the editor, on the top left
pane.</li>
<li>Finally, the top right pane shows your Environment. If you define a
variable it would show up there. Try typing <code>x &lt;- 2</code> in
the Console and hit enter, what do you get in the
<strong>Environment</strong> pane?</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="warm-up" class="section level1">
<h1>Warm up</h1>
<p>Before we introduce the data, let’s warm up with some simple
exercises.</p>
<p><label for="tufte-mn-1" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-1" class="margin-toggle"><span
class="marginnote"><span style="display: block;">The top portion of your
R Markdown file (between the three dashed lines) is called
<strong>YAML</strong>. It stands for “YAML Ain’t Markup Language”. It is
a human friendly data serialization standard for all programming
languages. All you need to know is that this area is called the YAML (we
will refer to it as such) and that it contains meta information about
your document.</span></span></p>
<div id="step-1.-update-the-yaml" class="section level2">
<h2>Step 1. Update the YAML</h2>
<p>Open the R Markdown (Rmd) file in your project, change the author
name to your name. And go ahead and put in today’s date.</p>
<p><img src="img/yaml-raw-to-rendered-new.png" width="80%"  style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
</div>
<div id="step-2-knit-it" class="section level2">
<h2>Step 2: Knit it!</h2>
<p>Now, look for that little button at the top called “Knit” (in the
image below, it’s bounded in the red box). When you click it, you’ll see
some some activity under the <strong>Render</strong> tab in the Console
pane and a beautiful notebook (similar to what you’re reading now) will
appear in the bottom-right Console pane under the
<strong>Viewer</strong> tab.</p>
<p><img src="img/knit1.png" width="80%"  style="display: block; margin: auto auto auto 0;" /></p>
</div>
<div id="step-3.-submit-it-to-canvas" class="section level2">
<h2>Step 3. Submit it to Canvas</h2>
<p>When you’re all done with the HW assignment and you’re ready to
submit the rendered document to Canvas, you want to change the “Knit”
setting to <strong>Knit to PDF.</strong> To do this, select the dropdown
arrow and you will see the option for knitting to PDF. Click it and look
for the PDF document that has been generated in the same folder where
you placed the HW starter file. You will submit the PDF on Canvas.</p>
<p><img src="img/knit2.png" width="80%"  style="display: block; margin: auto auto auto 0;" /></p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="packages" class="section level1">
<h1>Packages</h1>
<p>R is an open-source language, and developers contribute functionality
to R via packages. In this assignment we will use the following
packages:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>tidyverse</strong>: a collection of packages for doing data
analysis in a “tidy” way</li>
<li><strong>bdsdata</strong>: a package (your instructors created) that
contains various data sets for this course (Behavioral Data Science
I)</li>
</ul>
<p>We use the <code>library()</code> function to load packages. In your
R Markdown document you should see an R chunk labelled
<code>load-packages</code> which has the necessary code for loading both
packages. You should also load these packages in your Console, which you
can do by sending the code to your Console by clicking on the
<strong>Run Current Chunk</strong> icon (green arrow pointing right
icon).</p>
<p><img src="img/load-packages-chunk-new.png" width="80%"  style="display: block; margin: auto auto auto 0;" /></p>
<p>Note that these packages also get loaded in your R Markdown
environment when you <strong>Knit</strong> your R Markdown document.</p>
</div>
<div id="data" class="section level1">
<h1>Data</h1>
<p>The data we will be working with is all about the show <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parks_and_Recreation">‘Parks and
Recreation,’</a> a popular mockumentary style sitcom that ran from
2009-2015. The dataset contains some information about every episode
from every season, and we will be focusing on which characters were
mentioned in each episode’s brief description on IMDB. We also have the
average IMDB user rating for each episode, but that is for another
day.</p>
<p><label for="tufte-mn-2" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-2" class="margin-toggle"><span
class="marginnote"><span
style="display: block;"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/">IMBD</a> is a
community-led online database for information related to films and
television. One of the features is “User Ratings” that allows people to
rate each episode on a scale from 1 to 10 (with 10 being the highest
possible score).</span></span></p>
<p>The data can be found in the <strong>bdsdata</strong> package, and
it’s called <code>parks_rec</code>. Since the dataset is distributed
with the package, we don’t need to load it separately; it becomes
available to us when we load the package.</p>
<p><label for="tufte-mn-3" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-3" class="margin-toggle"><span
class="marginnote"><span style="display: block;">NOTE: ‘parks_rec’ is
derived from a much more complete dataset that someone posted to the
site <a href="http://kaggle.com">Kaggle.com</a>. Kaggle is a great
online resource for aspiring and seasoned data scientists where lots of
interesting datasets are provided by a large, open community. If
curious, you can check out the original dataset <a
href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bcruise/parks-and-recreation-episode-data">here</a>.</span></span></p>
<p>You can view the dataset as a spreadsheet using the
<code>View()</code> function. Note that you should not put this function
in your R Markdown document, but instead type it directly in the
Console, as it pops open a new window (and the concept of popping open a
window in a static document doesn’t really make sense…). When you run
this in the console, you’ll see the following <strong>data
viewer</strong> window pop up.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">View</span>(parks_rec)</span></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="img/view-data-new.png" width="80%"  style="display: block; margin: auto auto auto 0;" /></p>
<p>If you hover over description of each episode in the data viewer you
can see the full description.</p>
<p>You can find out more about the dataset by inspecting its
documentation (which contains a <strong>data dictionary</strong>, name
of each variable and its description), which you can access by running
<code>?parks_rec</code> in the Console or using the Help menu in RStudio
to search for <code>parks_rec</code>.</p>
</div>
<div id="exercises" class="section level1">
<h1>Exercises</h1>

<p>Let’s now look at the character “Leslie” played by Amy Poehler. We
want to find out which season she shows up the most within each
episode’s description.</p>
<p>For this we need to first <code>filter</code> the data to just get
rows with “Leslie” as the character and count how many of these “Leslie”
rows occur in each level of <code>season</code>.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>parks_rec <span class="sc">%&gt;%</span></span>
<span id="cb3-2"><a href="#cb3-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  <span class="fu">filter</span>(character <span class="sc">==</span> <span class="st">&quot;Leslie&quot;</span>) <span class="sc">%&gt;%</span></span>
<span id="cb3-3"><a href="#cb3-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  <span class="fu">count</span>(season, <span class="at">sort =</span> <span class="cn">TRUE</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>##   season  n
## 1      2 24
## 2      4 22
## 3      6 22
## 4      5 21
## 5      3 16
## 6      7  8
## 7      1  6</code></pre>
<p>In examining Leslie’s mentions in each season, there looks like a big
decline for some of the seasons compared to the rest. Is this really the
case? In thinking critically, what else might be going on? Perhaps there
are just fewer episodes in Seasons 1 and 7? Well, let’s find out.</p>
<p>To do this, let’s start by grouping the data by season and then
counting the number of rows in each season. R makes this really easy to
do with the <code>group_by</code> function.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>parks_rec <span class="sc">%&gt;%</span></span>
<span id="cb5-2"><a href="#cb5-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  <span class="fu">group_by</span>(season) <span class="sc">%&gt;%</span></span>
<span id="cb5-3"><a href="#cb5-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  <span class="fu">count</span>(<span class="at">sort =</span> <span class="cn">TRUE</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 7 × 2
## # Groups:   season [7]
##   season     n
##    &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt;
## 1      6   100
## 2      4    98
## 3      5    97
## 4      3    68
## 5      2    62
## 6      7    35
## 7      1     9</code></pre>
<p>Oh. Oh. This doesn’t look right. Were there really 100 episodes in
Season 6?! Clearly each row does not correspond to a unique episode. So,
what is going on? When we visually reinspect our data using
<code>View(parks_rec)</code>, we might notice the following. Some of the
rows have repeated episode numbers for each season because multiple
characters can be mentioned for each episode.</p>
<p><img src="img/repeated-lines.png" width="80%"  style="display: block; margin: auto auto auto 0;" /></p>
<p>We want to run the same code we just used (with the
<code>group_by</code> function), but after grouping by season, we want
to get distinct episode numbers before counting. In other words, in the
pipeline of the code, we want to add <code>distinct(episode_num)</code>
somewhere. When you run the udpated code, you should get the following
output:</p>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 7 × 2
## # Groups:   season [7]
##   season     n
##    &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt;
## 1      2    24
## 2      4    22
## 3      5    22
## 4      6    22
## 5      3    16
## 6      7    11
## 7      1     6</code></pre>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Write the following code, just like before, but you need to update
it by adding into the pipeline the code
<code>distinct(episode_num)</code> (don’t forget to use the
<code>%&gt;%</code>)</li>
</ol>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb8"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb8-1"><a href="#cb8-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>parks_rec <span class="sc">%&gt;%</span></span>

<span id="cb8-3"><a href="#cb8-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  <span class="fu">count</span>(<span class="at">sort =</span> <span class="cn">TRUE</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>🧶 ✅ ⬆️ <em>Write your answer in your R Markdown starter document
under Exercise 4, knit the document as a “html_document” (default output
in the YAML).</em></p>
<p>Now knowing there there are a different number of episodes for each
season, looking at the raw count of how many times a character is
mentioned across episodes does not really allow us to compare across
seasons. For example, Leslie appears 6 times in Season 1, but 21 times
in Season 5. But from our analysis, we know there are only 6 total
episodes in Season 1, and she is featured in 100% of them
(<code>6/6 = 1.0</code>). This is similar to the 95.45%
(<code>21/22 = 0.95</code>) of episodes she is featured in for Season
5.</p>
<p><label for="tufte-mn-5" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-5" class="margin-toggle"><span
class="marginnote"><span style="display: block;">Clearly Leslie is the
focus of the show! Most of the plots involve her in some featured
way.</span></span></p>
<p>The following visualization compares Leslie’s mentions to some of the
more mid-tier characters, taking proportion of overall episodes into
account.</p>
